Setup:  
cd src  
find . -name "*.class" | xargs rm  
javac ut/distcomp/threepc/Driver.java  

Clear logs (start over):  
rm *.log  

To run N processes:  
java ut/distcomp/threepc/Driver i N [-delay D] [-partialCommit p] [-deathAfter dn dp]  
	N	: total no. of processes  
	i	: this process' ID (0 to N-1)  
	D	: delay in milliseconds (applied at all send/receive events)  
	p	: if leader, commit only to process p and fail  
	dn, dp	: die after receiving dn messages from process dp  

Example usage (run in different tabs / terminals for clarity):  
java ut/distcomp/threepc/Driver 0 5 -delay 250 -partialCommit 2 -deathAfter 1 3  
java ut/distcomp/threepc/Driver 1 5 -delay 250  
java ut/distcomp/threepc/Driver 2 5 -delay 250 -deathAfter 2 1  
java ut/distcomp/threepc/Driver 3 5 -delay 250 -deathAfter 2 1 -deathAfter 3 4  
java ut/distcomp/threepc/Driver 4 5 -delay 250
